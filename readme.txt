== Description ==

With a simple shortcode you can enable and embed a javascript viewer called thingiview. This plugin is still under development and things might change alot until version 1.0.

In the current version:

* STL files have to be uploaded to /wp-content/uploads
* the viewer can't be used more than one time per page. This might be a feature because the viewer needs a lot of resources.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

3. Upload an STL-File to WordPress
4. Insert the shortcode [stl file="filename.stl" /]

If no filename is specified it will look for a file with the name 'your_post_title'-web.stl. This will be changed so you can customize it.

5. You can use the following options in the shortcode. These will override the default settings.

* file: the filname in wp-content/uploads/
* width: width of the viewer. Can be in % or px.
* height: height of the viewer. Can be in % or px.
* floor: url to floor texture
* rotation: rotate the object (x,y,z) in degrees.

== Screenshots ==

1. The viewer with control buttons (outdated since the controls are currently not available).
