== Description ==

With a simple shortcode you can enable and embed a WebGL viewer to show 3d stl files.

In the current version:

* STL files have to be uploaded to /wp-content/uploads
* The viewer can't be used more than one time per page. This might be a feature because the viewer needs a lot of resources.

A complete description of the plugin can be found on [my blog](https://www.db4cl.com/projects/stlviewer-1-0-for-wordpress/).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

3. Upload an STL-File to WordPress
4. Insert the shortcode [stl file="filename.stl" ]
