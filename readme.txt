== Description ==

With a simple shortcode you can enable and embed a javascript viewer called thingiview. This plugin is still under development and things might change alot until version 1.0.

In the current version:

* STL files have to be uploaded to /wp-content/uploads
* the viewer can't be used more than one time per page. This might be a feature because the viewer needs a lot of resources.

This plugin uses thingiview. Check out the HowTo in the Installtion tab.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

3. Upload an STL-File to WordPress
4. Insert the shortcode [stl file="filename.stl" /]

5. You can use the following options in the shortcode. These will override the default settings.

* file: the filname in wp-content/uploads/
* color: set the object color (hex value).
* background: set the background color (hex value).
* width: width of the viewer. Can be in % or px.
* height: height of the viewer. Can be in % or px.
* show controls: use true/false to show/hide the control buttons.
